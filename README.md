At my Church the membership is divided into 4 houses which are named Esther, Ruth, Matthew and Daniel. Each house undertakes fund raising activities and so the fund raising committee needs to monitor the status of funds collected on a Monthly basis. My project is to create an app or website where the fund raising committee can present the data. House members can then click a link on their devices to see the status of funds in each house and also make comments and ask questions.
